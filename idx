    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it
      would be the ideal place to come to learn more about birdwatching,
      whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding, or
      an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other
      like-minded people.

    <p>
      So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and
      get out into the great outdoors!
